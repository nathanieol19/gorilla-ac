    <p>We are the <strong>top heating and air conditioning
    </strong> company for residential and light commercial

        systems by providing all options for repairs. </p><br>

        <h3>When should you call a professional?</h3><br>

        <h4>Check your filter</h4>

        <p>Make sure to check your air conditioning <strong>filter </strong> and that you are changing them
            every <strong><em>six months. </em></strong> WHen filters become clogged than systems are 
            no longer able to deliver the proper amount of air flow and they will start to freeze the indoor coils.
        </p><br>

        <h4>Check your circuit Breaker</h4>

        <p>Circuit Breakers may flip off on hotter days due 
            to the strain put on compressors.</p><br>
            
        <h4>Check your thermostat batteries</h4>
